//! Apple High Performance's sound: what the stream is.
//!
//! The Mac's `RemoteDesktopSystemAudio` transmitter encodes AAC-ELD (MPEG-4 audio
//! object type 39) whatever the negotiation agreed — see `docs/apple-vnc-889.md`.
//! Nothing here decodes it: every browser is passed the Mac's units as they came
//! ([`crate::vnc_apple_media::PASSED_SOUND`]), described by the constants below,
//! and decodes them itself.
//!
//! RTP carries bare access units with no header naming the stream, so the
//! AudioSpecificConfig is stated here, once, from measurement: 48 kHz, stereo,
//! 480-sample frames (the RTP timestamp advances exactly 480 per packet), no SBR
//! and no error-resilience tools. Run against 377 captured frames, a decoder
//! configured with it decoded 375 cleanly and concealed two; every other reading —
//! 512-sample frames, the resilience flags, SBR — either refused the configuration
//! or concealed most of the stream.

/// AudioSpecificConfig for what the Mac sends, bit by bit:
///
/// ```text
/// 11111   audioObjectType escape
/// 000111  audioObjectType 39 - 32 = ER AAC ELD
/// 0011    samplingFrequencyIndex 3 = 48 000 Hz

/// 1       frameLengthFlag: 480-sample frames
