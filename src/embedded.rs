//! A managed local gateway: one browser instance, one private socket, one token.
//!
//! `remotex serve-embedded --instance-dir <dir>` is not a deployment. It is
//! started by an instance manager, serves that browser instance alone, and dies
//! with its parent. Everything that makes a `serve` gateway configurable is
//! therefore decided here instead: it listens on its private transport —
//! `<instance-dir>/gateway.sock`, or a named pipe on Windows, see [`transport`] —
//! and there is no login to offer — see [`crate::config::Audience::Embedded`].
//!
//! The SPA it serves is the same browser client as `remotex serve`. The token below
//! stands in for the login: the master listener seeds it with an `HttpOnly` response
//! cookie before proxying the browser to the child, so the page authenticates itself
//! the way any logged-in browser does and the manager needs no session protocol of
//! its own.
//!
//! Two pipes carry the whole arrangement, in opposite directions, and neither one
//! carries the other's job:
//!
//! - **stdout, once**: the [`Handshake`] line, printed after the endpoint is bound
//!   so its name in it is a fact rather than an intention. It is how the parent
//!   learns the endpoint is ready and receives the token, and it is the only thing
//!   this process writes to stdout — logging goes to stderr for the parent to
//!   retain.
//! - **stdin, never**: nothing is written to it in either direction. It exists so
//!   this process can notice that its parent is gone; see [`parent_closed`].
//!
//! The token is handed over that way rather than through `argv` (which `ps` shows
//! to every process on the machine), the environment (inherited by anything either
//! side spawns), or a file (which outlives the process that made it). A pipe's read
//! end belongs to this process and its write end to the parent, and both disappear
//! when they do.
