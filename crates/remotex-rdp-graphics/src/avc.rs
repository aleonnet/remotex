//! The H.264 the graphics pipeline draws video with, put back into colour.
//!
//! A Windows host that finds the client able to take H.264 does not switch the
//! desktop to it. It goes on drawing text and windows with ClearCodec and
//! Progressive, and hands the parts that move like video — a player, a game, a
//! scrolling page — to AVC420 in the same frames, each surface with an H.264 stream
//! of its own whose picture is the whole surface. The metablock in front of every
//! access unit ([`crate::proto::avc`]) says which rectangles of that picture are to
//! be shown; the rest is whatever the encoder left there.
//!
//! # Who decodes
//!
//! Not this crate. It has no H.264 decoder and is not to grow one: the access
//! units are decoded by whoever composes the pipeline, which is the page, with the
//! browser's own decoder. So the work is in three steps, and the caller drives
//! them for each run of commands:
//!
//! 1. [`scan`] the run for its access units, in the order the compositor will
//!    reach them, and for the surfaces whose streams end in it.
//! 2. Decode each unit, each surface's through a decoder of its own, and supply
//!    the picture under the unit's number
//!    ([`crate::Compositor::supply`]) — the samples the unit's rectangles show, as
//!    the decoder laid them out ([`Picture`]).
//! 3. Compose the run. A command that carries H.264 takes its units' pictures and
//!    paints its rectangles from them; one whose picture was not supplied leaves
//!    its rectangles as they were, as a codec payload that does not decode does.
//!
//! # What is done here
//!
//! AVC420 is the plain case: the masked rectangles converted from full-range
//! BT.709 YUV to RGB, the conversion [MS-RDPEGFX] 3.3.8.3.1 names — done here from
//! the samples rather than left to whatever drew the decoder's picture, because a
//! browser labels this stream's colour differently from one decoder to the next.
//! AVC444 is the same picture at full chroma resolution, carried as two YUV420
//! pictures through the one decoder: a *luma* view holding the luma and a quarter
//! of the chroma, averaged, and a *chroma* view whose three planes hold the other
//! three quarters, packed one of two ways ([`Layout`]). The luma view is kept
//! after it is shown, because the chroma view for a rectangle may come in a later
//! frame and combines with the last luma view that drew it. Putting the views back
//! together is [MS-RDPEGFX] 3.3.8.3.2 and 3.3.8.3.3, including the filter that
//! recovers the averaged samples from their three neighbours.
