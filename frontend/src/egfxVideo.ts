// The H.264 decoders of a passed RDP pipeline: EXPERIMENTAL, behind a target's
// `egfx_h264` key (rdpH264.ts).
//
// A host that draws video with H.264 gives every surface it draws that way a stream
// of its own, and each stream is a chain: an access unit means "what changed since
// the one before it". So there is one `VideoDecoder` for each surface, made on the
// surface's first unit and closed when the surface is created again or deleted, and
// every unit of a stream goes through its decoder in the order it arrived, shown or
// not.
//
// The stream is the host's as it came: Annex B, its parameter sets inline at each
// keyframe, so a decoder is configured with a codec string and no description. The
// string is made from the parameter set's own profile and level, which the
// compositor's scan reads off the unit (egfxCompositor.ts), and a keyframe that
// names another configures the decoder again.
//
// **One picture for each unit, awaited.** The compositor composes a run's commands
// in order and takes a unit's picture where its command is, so a unit is decoded
// and its picture in hand before the run is composed. So the decoder has to give
// one picture out for one unit in, holding none back for the units after it, which
// the page finds out before a host is told it may send H.264: it puts a stream of
// its own through these decoders when it loads (rdpH264.ts). One that then gives
// none in time, or fails, ends the pipeline, since the host sends no keyframe to a
// client that asks and the units after it are a chain with a link missing.
