//! The page's compositor for an RDP host's graphics pipeline.
//!
//! In a session started with the pipeline passed the gateway passes its commands
//! to the browser instead of composing them and encoding the picture. This is what
//! composes them there: the gateway's own compositor and codecs, which are the
//! `remotex-rdp-graphics` crate both are built with, behind the few calls the paint
//! worker makes (`frontend/src/egfxCompositor.ts`).
//!
//! The framebuffer stays in this module's memory, which is shared with the threads
//! below: the page uploads the rectangles a run painted out of it, into a texture.
//!
//! H.264 is the one codec not decoded here: the page decodes a run's access units
//! with the browser's own decoder before it composes the run, and hands each
//! picture's samples into this memory ([`Egfx::units`], [`Egfx::reserve`],
//! [`Egfx::supply`]).
//!
//! Progressive's tiles are decoded side by side, on rayon's pool, and a page has no
//! threads to spawn: a thread is a worker the page starts, running an instance of
//! this module on the one memory. So the pool's threads are seats the page's workers
//! take ([`run_pool_thread`]) before the pool is made of them ([`start_pool`]). A
//! module whose pool was never started composes on the thread that calls it.
