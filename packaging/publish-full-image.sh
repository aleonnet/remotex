# Build the image release CI never publishes — the public image with Debian's
# libavcodec61 installed, the High Performance decoder its gateway loads at run
# time — and the EXPERIMENTAL
# software HEVC decoder's release archive, which no release artifact holds — and
# push it to the operator's private registry, ghcr.io/aleonnet/alumia-full,
# under the tag's own name (v0.0.294).
#
# The tags it builds are release tags, and it builds nothing of alumia: the
# release workflow has published the public image of the tag, and this is one
# layer over that image's linux/amd64 half, installing the library and
# placing the archive the tag's src/hevc_wasm.rs pins, downloaded from the
# private andrewtheguy/hevc-wasm-archives through `gh` and checked against that
# pin, in /opt/alumia/versions/<version>/share/alumia, the release tree's data
# directory, where the gateway looks for it (src/config.rs, data_dir) and,
# finding it, serves it: the mounted config says nothing of it.
#
# A tag whose gateway links the decoder rather than loading it, still decodes
# the Mac's sound with fdk-aac, pins no software decoder, or looks for it
# elsewhere, is refused.
#
# The package must stay private: the public image leaves the decoder out, and a
# public package is a release artifact. The first push creates it `internal` —
# readable by the organization — and only the package's settings page on GitHub
# can make it private; there is no API for it. This script asks ghcr whether an
# anonymous client can pull the package, and does not push unless the answer is
# no or there is no package yet, and fails unless it is no after the push.
#
# Log in first, to ghcr with a token that has `write:packages`, and to GitHub
# with access to andrewtheguy/hevc-wasm-archives:
#
#   podman login ghcr.io
#   gh auth login
#
#   packaging/publish-full-image.sh TAG
#
#   TAG  the released tag to build on, e.g. v0.0.286
